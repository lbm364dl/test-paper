Understanding the interaction between economic growth and ecological sustainability is crucial for long-term urban planning. This paper proposes a model to assess these trade-offs.\n\n# Theoretical Framework\n\nWe develop a conceptual framework that links urban economic activity with environmental indicators such as air quality, green space, and biodiversity. The model assumes that economic growth can be achieved without compromising key ecological functions, up to certain thresholds.\n\n# Methods\n\n## Data Sources\n\nWe used simulated data representing urban population growth, economic output, and ecological metrics over a 20-year period.\n\n## Model Description\n\nThe model integrates economic indicators with ecological constraints. Key equations include:\n\n$$\nE_t = E_{t-1} + \\alpha \\cdot G_t - \\beta \\cdot U_t\n$$\n\nwhere $E_t$ is the ecological index at time $t$, $G_t$ is economic growth, and $U_t$ represents urbanization pressures.\n\n# Results\n\nOur simulation shows that moderate economic growth can be sustained without significant ecological degradation, provided that urban planning policies enforce green space and pollution controls. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the projected trends.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe results indicate that careful policy design can balance economic and ecological objectives. Comparing our findings with previous studies, we see consistent evidence that integrated urban planning mitigates environmental risks.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis study highlights the importance of combining economic and ecological modeling to inform urban sustainability policies. Future research should include real-world case studies and sensitivity analyses.\n\n# Test\n\n## Section\nThis is a simple placeholder for the manuscript's main document [@knuth84].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# This is code\na <- 1 + 2\nprint(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is new \n\n![test image](imgs/test.png)\n\nThis is new content.
