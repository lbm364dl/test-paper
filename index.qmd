  Urban ecosystems are increasingly affected by the interaction between economic growth and environmental sustainability.
  In this study, we present a new integrated model that quantifies the trade-offs between urban development and ecological preservation.
  Our findings suggest policy measures that balance economic and environmental objectives.

# Introduction

Urban areas are rapidly expanding, creating pressures on local ecosystems [@knuth84]. Understanding the interaction between economic growth and ecological sustainability is crucial for long-term urban planning. This paper proposes a model to assess these trade-offs.

# Theoretical Framework

We develop a conceptual framework that links urban economic activity with environmental indicators such as air quality, green space, and biodiversity. The model assumes that economic growth can be achieved without compromising key ecological functions, up to certain thresholds.

# Methods

## Data Sources

We used simulated data representing urban population growth, economic output, and ecological metrics over a 20-year period.

## Model Description

The model integrates economic indicators with ecological constraints. Key equations include:

$$
E_t = E_{t-1} + \alpha \cdot G_t - \beta \cdot U_t
$$

where $E_t$ is the ecological index at time $t$, $G_t$ is economic growth, and $U_t$ represents urbanization pressures.

# Results

Our simulation shows that moderate economic growth can be sustained without significant ecological degradation, provided that urban planning policies enforce green space and pollution controls. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the projected trends.

# Discussion

The results indicate that careful policy design can balance economic and ecological objectives. Comparing our findings with previous studies, we see consistent evidence that integrated urban planning mitigates environmental risks.

# Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of combining economic and ecological modeling to inform urban sustainability policies. Future research should include real-world case studies and sensitivity analyses.
